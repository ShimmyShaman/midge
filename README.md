A productivity oriented development environment.

#### Automation of process and workflow generation

Using historical tracking of utilized actions and processes allows statistical
suggestion and guidance of future user behaviour through repeatable tasks and
workflows. Reducing mechanical and cognitive expense to the developer to
increase productivity.

#### Dynamic recompilation
  
Using the [cling c++ interpreter](https://root.cern.ch/cling) to enable dynamic
evaluation and quicker readjustments of projects.

#### Maximal configuration of development environment
  
The development environment itself (as much as possible) is built using dynamic
recompilation which allows reconfiguration by the developer however it may serve
best.
