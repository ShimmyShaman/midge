# **midge**

A productivity oriented development environment.

#### Dynamic recompilation
  
Using the [cling c++ interpreter](https://root.cern.ch/cling) to enable dynamic
evaluation and quicker readjustments of projects.

#### Maximal configuration of development environment
  
The development environment itself (as much as possible) is built using dynamic
recompilation which allows reconfiguration by the developer however it may serve
best.

#### Automation of process and workflow generation

Using historical tracking of utilized actions and processes for statistical
suggestion for collaboration with the user to construct workflow processes. These
processes can be used for guidance of future user behaviour through repeatable
tasks and workflows. This reduces mechanical and cognitive expense to the developer
to increase productivity.
