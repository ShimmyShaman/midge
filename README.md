# __midge__

A graphical development environment intended for use with machine intelligent systems.

#### Automation of process and workflow generation

Using historical tracking of utilized actions and processes for statistical
suggestion for collaboration with the user to construct workflow processes. These
processes can be used for guidance and prediction of future user behaviour through
repeatable tasks and workflows. This reduces mechanical and cognitive expense to the
developer to increase productivity.

#### Interface for AI collaboration

Providing the interactive means to develop in collaboration with increasingly useful
AI ('2.0') functions to produce software faster.

#### Dynamic recompilation
  
Using the [cling c++ interpreter](https://root.cern.ch/cling) to enable dynamic
evaluation and quicker readjustments of projects.

#### Maximal configuration of development environment
  
The development environment itself (as much as possible) is built using the
dynamic recompilation which allows reconfiguration by the developer however
it may serve best. This can be done by accessing the code that runs the
development environment _by using the development environment_.

## Progress

_This project is still very much in the discovery process and no useful releases are
in any immediate future._
